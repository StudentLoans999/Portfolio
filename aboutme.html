									<h2 style="color: red;">My Past</h2>
									<p>In high school, I took a programming class and that was my introduction into participating in the world of technology. 
										I first learned about the foundation of computer science and languages, with a focus on HTML, CSS, and Python.</p>
									<p>Now here's the twist, I'm not going to lie to you and say I fell in love with it all and was a happy camper from the start. 
										I struggled with that class, even though I found it fascinating, I just couldn't wrap my head around the concepts and thinking in a purely logical, robot-like manner that programming entails and demands.</p>
									<p>So I took it upon myself to retake the same level one class the next year since I didn't feel I was adept enough to continue on to the next level. 
										The curriculum had changed slightly, so that kept it fresh with some new material, but this time around I was able to grasp it all with ease after I spent the summer studying the subject matter. 
										But, I believe what really got me into the knack of it was taking the game development class that same year.</p>
									<p>In that new class, I learned about game design and worked with GameMaker designing and developing small games.</p>
									<h2 style="color: blue;">This was it, I found my passion!!!</h2>
									<p>My excitement began to build about this brand new area of software development I hadn't experienced before! I got so inspired I went above and beyond the class content and expectations and started advancing on my projects at home.
										By the end of the class, I had finished off a couple of games that I then published as apps to both the iPhone and Android app stores.</p>
										<p>Throughout the next few years I would work off and on for some video game ideas I had, by using Unreal Engine, just for the fun of it and to see what I can learn and accomplish.</p>
										<p>As an aside, I also took part in an after-school club, CyberPatriot.</p>
									<br>
									<h2 style="color:chocolate; text-decoration: black underline overline;">Mobile Computer Class Teacher</h2>
									<p>I attained my first professional experience in IT by working at an after-school program across multiple middle schools, teaching kids programming (Lua) through a custom Minecraft mod called TurtleCraft.
										They interacted with and guided a pet turtle in the game, through the use of lines of code that they wrote that issued commands for the turtle to follow. I led and taught them along the way.
									To them, they were playing their favorite video game, but what they may not have realized, was that they were learning how to program!</p>
									<h2 style="color:chocolate; text-decoration: black underline overline;">Help Desk Support Technician</h2>
									<p>My next step in my journey introduced me into a whole other territory. It was similar to my teaching job before, in that I was using my technical know-how to help people out, but this time around I was providing customer support to end-users.
										In this role, what I learned most was how to behave in a professional IT business, like following their established processes and procedures to best serve the clients' and company's interests.
										What I appreciated most was working with a team to achieve a shared goal that involved multiple steps along the way, with everything kept track in Jira, a ticketing system and also our well-written documentation.
									</p>
									<h2 style="color:chocolate; text-decoration: black underline overline;">System Administrator</h2>
									<p>After that role ended, I studied for and obtained my first technical certificate, the <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/6659d0c9-21e0-4508-b464-5b8358e2419c">CompTIA A+</a> 
										since I heard that it is the introduction to IT and gives a general landscape of what you can see youreslf doing one day.
									    The test center where I took the exam was also part of a small business academy that prepared students for technical and business certifications through their in-person courses.
									    I spoke with a few of the employees about my technical experience and how I was looking for a new occupation and they told me to send them my resume and after I did.</p> 
										<h2 style="color: blue;">They had me come in for a trial week!</h2>
									    <p>During that week, they introduced me to the business and how it operates, and listed out some tech projects they've been meaning to get around to. I started working on some of them and 
										even suggested some others that would help out their business run more efficiently. After the trial week they hired me full-time. </p>
										<p>During my time there,
										 they encouraged me to take on more IT certifications and provided resources to help me achieve them. This led to me obtaining a lot of foundational IT certificates in multiple areas as I was trying to understand which appealed to me most,
										and where I should focus my efforts. They're all listed on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidrichey/details/certifications/">LinkedIn</a> but the most notable one in that time, in terms of effort, difficulty, and content length was the <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/7de32b24-7d48-4ce3-bde0-ad52f68dab13?source=linked_in_profile">CompTIA Security+</a>
									</p>
									<h2 style="color:chocolate; text-decoration: black underline overline;">Data Center Operations Technician</h2>
									<p>While working as a System Administrator, a recruiter reached out to me and that led to me going to full-time work at Amazon Web Services (AWS) and switching to freelance for my System Administrator position with my previous employer.
										At AWS, the main takeaway I got, was learning to adapt to the work culture and environment of a Fortune 500 company that is the industy leader in cloud computing. 
									</p>
									<p>Outside of my work at AWS, I took on learning cloud computing concepts, but I chose to study their competitor's services, Microsoft <a href="https://github.com/StudentLoans999/Azure">Azure</a> since I already was learning AWS' services at my workplace.
										This led to me passing the exam and receiving the certification <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/c0349450-dd6c-4a93-b069-b1d98b7cf73f/linked_in_profile">Azure Administrator Associate</a></p>
									<p>After my contract ended for AWS (I had decided to not renew it, in search of a different role since I felt I had learned all there was to learn at that position level) and went back to full-time work at Carver Institute (my previous employer).</p>
									
									<h2 style="color:chocolate; text-decoration: black underline overline;">Application Administrator</h2>
									<p> My new step in my career path was becoming an Application Administrator. That position was a mix of business/data analyst and system administrator.
										I created, ran, and worked with <a href="https://github.com/StudentLoans999/PowerShell">PowerShell</a> and <a href="https://github.com/StudentLoans999/Batch">Batch</a> scripts a lot in my day-to-day. 
										(I did a lot more but my LinkedIn/Resume explains it all better.) </p>
										<p>I wanted to supplement my professional experience in my current role so I studied a lot of different data analysis content providers
											 (<a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/91aa9908-1a91-4f7d-9419-e49bcf8a978e/public_url">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/V7NM8MHGSPEM">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/certificate/DAA0012453114879">DataCamp</a>) and received their certificates after passing their exams.
										I also wanted to work on producing visualizations because I found it fun being able to showcase data and make insights that drive business decisions with just at-a-glance dashboards and clean reports.
										So I created some dashboards and reports through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8h_7gDhr185xJcsKcpaFyXbmzMKpqdK_">PowerBI</a> (sometimes with raw data extracted from Excel) while learning SQL and R on the side to help shape the data.</p>
									
									<h2 style="color:chocolate; text-decoration: black underline overline;">Data Analyst</h2>
									<p>I'm currently working as a freelance Data Analyst, where I develop and maintain dashboards and reports to track key metrics and performance indicators, by using Tableau and PowerBI.
									</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2 style="color: yellow;">Now</h2>
									<p>For AWS I got certified as a <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/f03ecf85-8fb5-45ac-8cec-7c1b0b404bfd/linked_in_profile">Solutions Architect</a> after learning from multiple courses.</p>
									<p>Currently I'm building up my experience by working on and completing an array of projects and labs across multiple data analyst areas.</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2 style="color: green;">Next Steps</h2>
									<p>After I land a new role, I plan to continue my IT education and experience; bolstering my skillset and enriching my technical knowledge.</p>
									<p>I have some passion projects of mine I'm interested in pursuing that involve emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science.</p>
